Problem startement: In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, education is undergoing a profound transformation, embracing innovative tools and methodologies to engage and empower young learners. One such revolutionary approach is the integration of Intel and AI tools into interactive learning experiences for children. 
This synergy of advanced technology promises to revolutionize education by fostering personalized, immersive, and engaging learning environments that cater to the diverse needs and interests of every student. 
By harnessing the power of Intel's cutting-edge hardware and AI algorithms, educators can create dynamic educational experiences that inspire curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills in children, preparing them for success in the digital age and beyond. 

solution:
We have developed a chatbot which helps solve math problems and answers queries for students from grade 6 to 10
The provided code performs the following tasks:

-Imports necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.

-Defines functions for extracting text from PDF files, preprocessing text, and preprocessing the dataset.

-Loads a pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer for question answering.

-Defines functions for predicting answers, including handling large contexts.

-Implements a simple chatbot interface that allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on the preprocessed dataset and the BERT model.

-The chatbot allows users to interactively ask questions based on the preprocessed dataset. It preprocesses the user's input, predicts the answer using the BERT model, and returns the response.
